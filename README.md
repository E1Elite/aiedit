AIEdit
======

Editor for Red Alert 2 and Tiberium Sun AI.ini files.

Deezire's AI guide is included in case you need help figuring out what's what. The program usage itself should be self explanatory.

The accompanying strings.ini contains the correct settings for RA2/YR, but can be edited for TS or for your own mod.

Known issues
============

- The editor crashes if the ai.ini contains errors. For example, there are a couple of improperly formatted TriggerTypes in the Deezire ai.ini which you have to fix manually first.

- The editor also crashes if any AI Type contains references to units or buildings that do not exist in the rules.ini.

Changelog
