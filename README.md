AIEdit
======

Editor for Red Alert 2 and Tiberium Sun AI.ini files.

Deezire's AI guide is included in case you need help figuring out what's what. The program usage itself should speak for itself.

Known issues
============

- The editor crashes if the ai.ini contains errors. For example, there are a couple of improperly formatted TriggerTypes in the Deezire ai.ini which you have to fix manually first.

- The editor also crashes if any AI Type contains references to units or buildings that do not exist in the rules.ini.
